# Inventory & Vendor Data Analysis (Python + SQLite)

This is a simple data analysis project where I connected Python to a SQLite database and explored different tables to understand purchase and vendor-related data.

The project includes:
- Connecting to a SQLite database
- Checking what tables exist
- Viewing table data
- Filtering data for a specific vendor
- Doing basic analysis using Python and Pandas

## Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- SQLite Database
- Pandas Library

## What the Project Does
- Reads data from a SQLite database
- Shows all table names
- Displays row count and first few rows of each table
- Loads data into Pandas DataFrames
- Filters data by Vendor Number
- Helps understand purchases and sales for one vendor
